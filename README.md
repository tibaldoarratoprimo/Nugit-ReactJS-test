# Nugit-ReactJS-test

This project is an autocomplete (not yet but it will be soon !) search box on the Github API.

It enables users to search for repositories, commits, issues or topics linked with their text query.
It also allows them to select the languages used in the results shown on screen.
Given only 30 results can be displayed at the same time, users are allowed to change the page they want to be on screen.
The web page also indicates if multiple tests on results are passed.
